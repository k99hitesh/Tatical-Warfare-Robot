# Tatical-Warfare-Robot
Aim to develop a robot with improved technology, high-speed precision, and with advanced
features. The robot is remote-controlled. For this ESP8266 wifi module is used which will be
connected to the Blynk server and operated through a mobile device.[1] Blynk is open-source
software that is available for android users and as well as for iso users. Through this server,
Robot will be connected and operated. Earlier robots were equipped with a camera which had
a micro-sd card, memory of this micro-sd card was limited, to overcome this problem a
wireless camera is mounted that will transmit real-time video to the one operating it. The
robot is controlled by Arduino ATmega328P which is a 14 pin microcontroller.[2] For the
motion of the robot two DC Servo motors are used interfaced through L293D IC which is
connected to Arduino. Servo motors offer a high angular torque which will help the robot to
turn effortlessly. A metal detector is used to sense land mines. The robot will be on the harsh
terrain and lots of obstacles will come by, the robot should not fall upside down, to overcome
this a gyroscope is installed so that the robot do not fall on its back or on one side.
